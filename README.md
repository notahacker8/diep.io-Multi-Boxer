# Instructions
- Open the browser console
- Paste the code into the console
- Press 'Copy Party Link' in the top right corner of the main menu
- >> copied_party_link = "[paste link here]"
- >> multibox()
- Seperate the new tab into its own window - REALLY IMPORTANT
- >> hook()

# Notes
- Does not work in fullscreen
- The controlling window will be titled "diep.io (main)"
- If you ever need to undo the input sync:
- >> unhook()
- You can control the tanks individually by focusing onto windows that aren't the main window.
